So, anything you "did" this morning was reverted.<br>We have also given all subs +12hrs to cover the down time.<br><br>Because passwords for accounts were likely compromised, we setup a system to verify and unlock for players' protection. When you try to login you will be prompted to reset your password.  We can automatically unlock most players' accounts, but some will require manual support via email.  Just follow the directions and please be patient with us.<br><br>Sorry about the trouble.  HI1 was never designed to survive so long into this new mean digital world. ;)<br><br>P.S.  The XSS alert was a simple javascript alert, just meaningless and harmless.<br><br>Thanks!<BR><BR><B>[ June 9, 2020 ] <FONT COLOR=880000>2020 Fan Art Contest</FONT>:</B><BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to everyone that participated in the 2020 Fan Art Contest.<br><br>
